## Null

This explains the NULL commands found in the source.

```
Inserts 3 nulls at the start of each
line to eliminate change return
bounce problems.  Null should be 0
when entering paper tapes from Teletype®
readers.  When punching tapes Null≥3.
Higher settings are required on faster
mechanical terminals.

## Poke
I'm still researching what the exact meanings of the POKE commands are. Clearly, something controlling printing.
